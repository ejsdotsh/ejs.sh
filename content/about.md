hello, i'm e.j.

i'm `transgender`, `nonbinary`, `queer`, and my pronouns are they/them/theirs. there are various other identities and labels which might prove useful in understanding both my lived experiences, as well as the ways in which i interact with the world. some of these are: `bereaved`, `pansexual`, `intersectional feminist`, and `anti-racist`; more on these later.

this will be a place for me to (irregularly) share my thoughts, learnings, projects, and other miscellanea... please note that i tend to not use capitalization.

### professional

i design, build, and automate scalable, reliable, and secure (network) infrastructure. please see my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejsdotsh) for specifics.

### personal

i ride bikes (road, cyclocross), rollerskate, take pictures, read, make and consume copious amounts of coffee and gelato, play with tech, am constantly teaching myself/learning [something](../project), and sometimes i [write](https://ejs.wtf) about it.
